Understanding Human Sentiment Analysis Through Text And AI-Based Techniques...
We firstly scrapped the data through a website. We then preprocessed it and performed data cleaning. 
Through Web Scraping and UI design, we created a dashboard for human sentiment analysis.
We did the human sentiment analysis in four ways: 1) Created a pie chart 2) Made a Text-based Word Cloud 3) Created a drop down and find the reviews in it to be a positive or a negative one. 4) Let the customers write a review and find whether it is a positive or negative sentiment.
